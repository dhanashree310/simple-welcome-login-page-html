# E-Diary Project

Welcome to the E-Diary project! 
This project contains two main HTML files: `welcome.html` and `login.html`. 

## Introduction
The `welcome.html` page serves as an introduction to the E-Diary, encouraging users to start their journey, while the `login.html` page allows users to log in.

The `welcome.html` page features a visually appealing design with animations and a call-to-action button that directs users to the login page. The `login.html` page provides a form for users to enter their username and password.

Both pages are designed with a focus on aesthetics and user experience, featuring modern styling and responsive design to ensure they look great on all devices.
